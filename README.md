This is the code and reults repository of STKNet for handwritting recognition, which will be publiched in the paper named "Trajectory-based Handwriting Recognition via Spatiotemporal Convolution on Distance Matrix". The paper is currently under peer review. More information will be also available here after the paper is published.

To run the code of model training one have to download the MNIST squence data from https://edwin-de-jong.github.io/blog/mnist-sequence-data/

STKNet is a model to caculate the distance of handwriting trajectories. Below is the model structure
